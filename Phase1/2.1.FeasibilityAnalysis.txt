Feasibility Analysis (consider all aspects time, talent, staff, etc.)

Expected Benefits â€“ tangible and intangible

Estimated Costs

Make use of business tools to assess payback period, breakeven analysis

Assume executive support
Assume plenty of IT resources in Federated, only us in class


Operational Feasibility:
An application with DB is the most practical way to manage and auto MVR system
Management supports the project; current system has little automation; may cause a workforce reduction; the new system will require training, company is prepared to provide this. 
Users will not be involved too much due to classtime limitations; users will have to learn the new system.
Customers may find drivers are no longer available to be insured, this may look bad.
We need to ensure only the correct people see the MVR records as that is private information.

Technical feasibility
This is technically feasible, federated and our class have the resources and talent
Schedule feasibility:
Depends on how many more snow days we get.

Economic feasibility:
Costs:
	Staff and users
	Software development and maintenance
	Training costs
	Licenses and fees
	Costs of not having the system or postponing it. 
Calucluate the saveings in:
	Reduced MVR costs (calculate a ball park)
	Automated workforce
	Lower payout risk
	Intangible:
		Telling customers they can't insure a driver
		Allowing customers to pre vet drivers?
		Less employees, but may cause some to be laid off
		Better user experience and satisfaction
